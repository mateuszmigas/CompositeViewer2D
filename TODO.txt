todo:
- better strongly typed api for creating renderers
- treejs plugin
- pixijs plugin
- react plugin
- check if ww terminate is not called before dispose
- move render mode and profiling to render scheduler
- render params in schedule renderer
- full render/patch render
- make file casing consistent
- add angular example
- add vue example

profiling:
- observer memory usage, no leaks
- check idle state, should be min cpu and no gpu

done:
- make sure there is single render at start

ideas:
- each schedule render needs to invoke requestAnimationFrame otherwise
it gets desynchronized (ww and mt)
