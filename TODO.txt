todo:
- profiler text in canvas2s
- refactor profiling options
- renderpatch restrictions for orchestrator
- orchestrator with different kind of renderers
- treejs plugin
- pixijs plugin
- react plugin
- check if ww terminate is not called before dispose
- render params in schedule renderer
- full render/patch render
- make file casing consistent
- add angular example
- add vue example

problems:
- ios safari - does not like many canvases
- ios safari - kills inactive workers

bugs:
- fix not hiding performance monitor text

profiling:
- observer memory usage, no leaks
- check idle state, should be min cpu and no gpu

remember:
- each schedule render needs to invoke requestAnimationFrame otherwise
it gets desynchronized (ww and mt)

goals: 
- zero (little) dependency
- hack free
- 99% strongly typed
