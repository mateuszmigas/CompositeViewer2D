todo mvp:
- refactor profiling options
- create example

future: 
- render params in schedule renderer
- orchestrator with different kind of renderers
- add angular example
- add vue example

problems:
- ios safari - does not like many canvases
- ios safari - kills inactive workers

bugs:
- pixi sometimes goes out of sync after resize

profiling:
- observer memory usage, no leaks
- check idle state, should be min cpu and no gpu

remember:
- each schedule render needs to invoke requestAnimationFrame otherwise
it gets desynchronized (ww and mt)
